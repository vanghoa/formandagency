            Yeo Workshop is pleased to present a solo exhibition by Brandon Tay,
            a Singaporean artist whose practice is concerned with the emergent
            complexities related to digital materials. Primarily working through
            digital media, mediated sculptures, and the moving image, Tay’s
            works often complicate the distinctions between the tangible and the
            incorporeal, whilst addressing and contending with the relationality
            of their complex natures.
            <br></br>
            For his inaugural solo exhibition, Form & Agency, Brandon Tay
            introduces a new body of work that explores the materiality of the
            digital, through an engagement with 3D-printed sculptures,
            live-simulations, and virtual ecosystems. Introducing an element of
            experimentation, the exhibition functions on three different stacks
            — the physical artworks in the gallery space, the virtual components
            of the artworks, and a live and interactive game simulation — that
            operate both independently and in relation to each other.
            <br></br>
            At the core of the exhibition are five agents — dynamic actors —
            that are composed of 3D printed sculptures embedded with screens,
            sensors, as well as networking capabilities. Taking on different
            forms, they act as metaphors for various modes of intelligence: from
            adversarial neural networks, complex systems in nature, blackboxing,
            cybernetic decision trees, and reinforcement learning. To-gether,
            the networked sculptures transform the gallery space into an
